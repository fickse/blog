Decorrelation stretching is a useful technique for highlighting parts of images that might not otherwise be obvious. This is the technique used for creating false-color satellite images.

http://dhanushkadangampola.blogspot.com/2015/02/decorrelation-stretching.html[This blog post] has a nice explanation of the mechanics behind the technique, written in matlab. 

Here is a https://gist.github.com/fickse/82faf625242f6843249774f1545d7958[gist] for a function that performs decorrelation stretching in R. It uses basically the same principles, except instead of scaling the pixel values to unit variance in PCA-space, it stretches them further, by using their frequency histogram. The result is a very vibrant stretch.
